    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>They are not much things you need to know a bout me, basically i will start by saying that i like designs so much, which has made me to learn graphic designing at a tender age. After when i grew up, i discovered thta many people are going into graphic designing make it crowded, so i decided to further my designing knowledege by not only designing a 2D designs, and moved ahead to learn 3D designs, all to the help of Empowering Africa through education. I moved to designing 3D models with a software named "solid Edge", which i am now a certified 3D designer, and then i moved on to learning how to code and design the layout people see when they visit websites.
